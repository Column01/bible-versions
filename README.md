Due to copyright restrictions, this repository does **not** include any Bible translation text.
Instead, it provides scripts that let you scrape Bible translations across **37 languages** from **BibleHub.com** and store them as **JSON** for your own usage.
 
Each translation can be stored as its own `.json` file for easy parsing, analysis, app development, or AI projects.

## � Quick start
 
Step-by-step installation instructions live [here](src/bible_versions/scraping/QUICKSTART.md)
 
This repo includes scrapers for:
 
- **English**
  - [`bible-scraper --help`](src/bible_versions/scraping/english/bible_scraper.py)
- **Multi-language**
  - [`bible-scraper-multi-lang --help`](src/bible_versions/scraping/multi_language/bible_scraper_multi.py)
- **Apocrypha**
  - [`bible-scraper-apoc --help`](src/bible_versions/scraping/apocrypha/bible_scraper.py)
 
And a utility to split a combined scrape into one file per version:
 
- [`separate-versions --help`](src/bible_versions/scraping/separate_versions.py)

Other misc scripts:

- [`apply-book-name-map  --help`](src/bible_versions/scraping/multi_language/helpers/apply_book_name_mapping.py)
- [`build-book-name-map --help`](src/bible_versions/scraping/multi_language/helpers/build_book_name_mapping.py)
- [`build-locale-map --help`](src/bible_versions/scraping/multi_language/helpers/build_locale_version_map.py)
- [`orangize-versions-by-locale --help`](src/bible_versions/scraping/multi_language/helpers/organize_versions_by_locale.py)
 
## 📁 What files you get
 
- **Combined output**
  A single `bible_data.json` containing all scraped versions.
- **Per-version files (optional)**
  Use the `seperate-versions` tool to create a `versions/` folder with one JSON per translation/version.
- **HTML cache**
  The scrapers store cached verse HTML under `html_cache/` inside each scraper folder.
- **Progress file**
  The scrapers maintain `scraper_progress.json` so you can resume an interrupted scrape.

## 🗂️ Structure

The combined `bible_data.json` is stored as:
 
`VERSION -> Book -> Chapter -> Verse`

```json
{
  "NIV": {
    "Genesis": {
      "1": {
        "1": "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.",
        "2": "Now the earth was formless and empty..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- ✅ Top-level keys = Version codes/names
- ✅ Second-level keys = Book names
- ✅ Third-level keys = Chapter numbers
- ✅ Fourth-level keys = Verse numbers

## 🧠 Use Cases

- Bible apps and APIs
- AI and NLP text analysis
- Theological research
- Cross-version comparison tools
